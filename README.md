## Project 1: Undergraduate Individual Project: Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities in Smart Home IoT Devices

### Abstract  
Smart home devices are increasingly becoming a staple item in their households due
to their ease of use, energy efficiency, and automation features. However, their
growing inclusion into everyday life brings many different cybersecurity
vulnerabilities, which are often not addressed or are pushed aside while designing
these devices. This report explores the widespread vulnerabilities in smart home IoT
devices, including weak default credentials, insecure communication protocols, and
poor data privacy measures. By examining real-world attack vectors, such as the
Mirai botnet, and an analysis of the current mitigation strategies, this report highlights
the urgent need for improved security solutions in IoT ecosystems. The findings
emphasise that present solutions are often inadequate and propose novel
frameworks for enhanced protection, including hardware-based security
mechanisms, network-level monitoring, and cross-industry collaboration. The report
concludes with recommendations for future research and practical implementations.
